/*
(Airline Reservations System) A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated
reservations system. You’ve been asked to develop the new system. You’re to write an application
to assign seats on each flight of the airline’s only plane (capacity: 10 seats).
Your application should display the following alternatives: Please type 1 for First Class and
Please type 2 for Economy. If the user types 1, your application should assign a seat in the
firstclass section (seats 1–5).
If the user types 2, your application should assign a seat in the economy section (seats 6–10).
Your application should then display a boarding pass indicating the person’s seat number and
whether it’s in the first-class or economy section of the plane.
Use a one-dimensional array of primitive type boolean to represent the seating chart of the
plane. 
Initialize all the elements of the array to false to indicate that all the seats are empty.
As each seat is assigned, set the corresponding element of the array to true to indicate that the
seat is no longer available.
Your application should never assign a seat that has already been assigned. When the economy
section is full, your application should ask the person if it’s acceptable to be placed in the
first-class section (and vice versa).
If yes, make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, display the message
"Next flight leaves in 3 hours."
