/**
 * (Parking Charges) A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up
 * to three hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour
 * or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given
 * 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours
 * at a time. Write an application that calculates and displays the parking
 * charges for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday. You should
 * enter the hours parked for each customer. The program should display the
 * charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running
 * total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to
 * determine the charge for each customer.
